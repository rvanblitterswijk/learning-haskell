# learning-haskell
A repository made to document my haskell learning journey

## Local setup

## The learning process 
### My goal
During the course ASD-APP it is required of the students to show that they posses the ability to learn a new programming language by themselves. During this process it is important to learn 2 things: how to learn an unfamiliar programming paradigm and how to share the attained knowledge with peers. 

So my goal for this journey is threefold:
1. Learning a new programming language.
2. Becoming familiar with a new programming paradigm.
3. Improving my ability to share my newly attained knowledge with peers.

### Why Haskell?
To attain my goals I had to make a choice as to which programming language I was going to learn. To make an educated decision I decided to sum up some criteria.
1. The programming language should be commonly used by developers and fit a clear purpose. (This would ensure that the knowledge I was getting would actually be useful for me in the future)
2. The language should have a decently active community and good documentation. (If I was going to learn a language it would be important to have these things)
3. The programming language is of a different paradigm than the object oriented paradigm.
4. I had no experience with the programming language prior to starting.

After gathering my criteria I decided to check the programming languages proposed by the school. Out of this list I figured that Haskell fit the list the best. It is a language I have heard about several times during my time at school, it's a functional language and it has an extensive [documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation/).
